# Project Euler
My [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)-based solutions for [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems.

## Running a Solution
Use the `cargo run` command with the `--bin` flag with a zero-padded problem number. The example below shows how to run the first solution.
```shell
cargo run --bin 001
```
